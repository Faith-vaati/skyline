<!-- Now you have something that is resembling a building. You are ready to create your first variable. Variable declarations begin with two dashes (-) and are given a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value;.



To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). Whatever value you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you use it on.




Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2
);



Gradients can use as many colors as you want like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2,
  color3
);



You can specify where you want a gradient transition to complete by adding it to the color like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2 20%,
  color3
);


Gradient transitions often gradually change from one color to another. You can make the change a solid line like this:

linear-gradient(
  var(--first-color) 0%,
  var(--first-color) 40%,
  var(--second-color) 40%,
  var(--second-color) 80%
); -->
