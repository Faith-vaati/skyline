<!-- Now you have something that is resembling a building. You are ready to create your first variable. Variable declarations begin with two dashes (-) and are given a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value;.



To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). Whatever value you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you use it on.




Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element. They are applied to the background property and the syntax looks like this:

gradient-type(
  color1,
  color2
); -->
